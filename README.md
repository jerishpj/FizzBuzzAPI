# FizzBuzzAPI

This is a web API application developed in .Net Core to perform Fizz Buzz logic.

## What is the logic behind this API?

Create a series of numbers with Fizz buzz logic. That means in a series of numbers, if the number is exactly divisible by 3, then reurns text 'fizz'.
If the number is exactly divisible by 5, then returns 'buzz'. If the number is divisble by 3 and 5, then return 'fizzbuzz'.

## How this works?

REST API accepts a number and returns back the Fizz Buzz Series upto that number.
For Example : If we give input as 15, the result will be:  
 1, 2, fizz, 4, buzz, fizz, 7, 8, fizz, buzz, 11, fizz, 13, 14, fizzbuzz
